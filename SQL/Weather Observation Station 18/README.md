# Weather Observation Station 18

Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

### Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
